## Cade Information

Cade is a discord music bot with crystal-clear Audio, that's free, 24/7!
## Commands

The commands are simple. We have, from the start, decided to use Slash Commands, because we didn't want to apply message intents (See, we're keeping up with progress!)

```
/play
/queue
/pause
/resume
/nowplaying
/skip
/join
/leave
/loop
/volume 

**New Commands**
/stop
```

## FAQ

```
Q) Cade is offline, what should I do?
A) Cry about it. No. Report it to us or check the status on our support server!

Q) Will there ever be Cade Premium?
A) No, we do not want to make profit of this bot, made it only out of boredom!

FAQ Will be updated every few days.
