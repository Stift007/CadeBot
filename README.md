## Cade Information

Cade is a discord music bot with crystal-clear Audio, that's free, 24/7!
## Commands

The commands are simple. We have, from the start, decided to use Slash Commands, because we didn't want to apply message intents (See, we're keeping up with progress!)

```
/play
/queue
/pause
/resume
/nowplaying
/skip
/join
/leave
/loop
/volume 

**New Commands**
/stop
```

## FAQ


Q) Cade is offline, what should I do?
A) Check the status channel. And report to the Admins.

Q) Cade is offline on my server, but online on other servers! Now what?
A) Cade uses a System called `Sharding`, meaning different Bot instances. However, shards may go down from time to time. Be patient, they'll come back again

Q) Will there ever be Cade Premium?
A) Chances are there, but I don't think so. Besides, who would actually pay money to get more features on a bot that's complete trash?

FAQ Will be updated every few days.
